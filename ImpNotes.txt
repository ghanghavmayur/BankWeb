Model:
	-Data in the Model is only available during the current 
	 request. Once the request is completed, the Model data 
	 is discarded.
	-Data added to the Model is directly accessible in the 
	 view (e.g., JSP templates) using placeholders like ${}.

HttpSession: 
	-The HttpSession is used to store data across multiple 
	 requests during a user's session. The data persists as 
	 long as the session is active (or until the user logs out).
	-Data stored in the session is available globally across
	 multiple controllers, views, or requests for the same user.
